        Some credit cards earn versatile travel-miles or points that can be redeemed flexibly — for flights, hotel nights, travel expenses or cash-equivalent credits. This page explains how those cards function and what matters when you choose one.

  <!-- Overview -->
  <section id="overview" class="section">
    <h2>What Is a Travel-Miles / Flexible Reward Card?</h2>
    <p>A travel-miles credit card functions like a hybrid between a frequent-flyer card and a flexible rewards card: it accumulates a proprietary “miles or points” currency based on spend and sometimes travel. You can often redeem miles for flights, hotels, travel expenses — or other travel-related services.</p>
    <p>Unlike airline-only cards or hotel loyalty cards, a travel-miles card keeps things flexible: you’re not tied to one airline or chain. The value depends on how you use the miles and whether the redemption options match your travel style.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Earning -->
  <section id="earning" class="section">
    <h2>How Spending Translates Into Travel Miles</h2>
    <p>Everyday purchases usually earn a base number of miles or points. Some cards boost earnings for travel, dining, transportation or foreign-currency transactions. Many “miles” cards also include sign-up bonuses, accelerated bonuses for first months, or spend-based annual bonuses.</p>
    <p>If the card offers transfer partners (airlines, hotels, travel services), these bonuses can compound: you earn miles from spend, then transfer or redeem for travel — increasing the overall value per point.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Redeeming & Flexibility -->
  <section id="redeem" class="section">
    <h2>Redemption Options — What to Compare</h2>
    <p>You might redeem miles as flight bookings, hotel stays, statement credits for travel costs, travel portal bookings, or transfer to partner programs. Each redemption path often has a different effective value per mile, depending on exchange rate, surcharges or transfer rates.</p>
    <p>Flexible travel-miles cards tend to work best if you value choice and flexibility — you’re not locked into one airline or hotel chain. However, value per mile may vary a lot depending on how you use it, and you need to choose redemption paths carefully to get good value.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- What to Watch Out For -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Trade-Offs, Fees and Risks</h2>
    <p>Because travel-miles programs are more general than co-branded cards, redemption value per mile is usually lower. Some redemption options (e.g. cash-credit or portal bookings) offer lower value than airline redemptions. You might need many miles for a meaningful benefit.</p>
    <p>Annual fees, foreign-transaction fees, expiry rules or devaluation risk can erode value as well. It’s crucial to check the issuer’s terms, redemption charts and whether the miles are compatible with the travel services you use.</p>
